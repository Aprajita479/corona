# COVID-19 Data Scraper and Analysis

This Python script scrapes data from the Worldometer website (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) to retrieve COVID-19 statistics for individual countries. The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the website, and then uses BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML response and extract the required data.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Set the URL for the Worldometer website:
```python
url = 'https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/'
```

3. Send an HTTP GET request to the website and retrieve the HTML content:
```python
r = requests.get(url)
html = r.text
```

4. Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup:
```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
```

5. Extract and print the global COVID-19 statistics:
```python
live_data = soup.find_all('div', id='maincounter-wrap')
for i in live_data:
    print(i.text)
```

6. Extract and analyze the COVID-19 data for individual countries:
```python
table_body = soup.find('tbody')
table_rows = table_body.find_all('tr')
countries = []
cases = []
todays = []
deaths = []
for tr in table_rows:
    td = tr.find_all('td')
    countries.append(td[0].text)
    cases.append(td[1].text)
    todays.append(td[2].text)
    deaths.append(td[3].text)
indices = [i for i in range(1, len(countries) + 1)]
headers = ['countries', 'total cases', 'todays cases', 'deaths']
df = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(countries, cases, todays, deaths)), columns=headers, index=indices)
```

7. Save the extracted data to a CSV file:
```python
df.to_csv('corona.csv')
```

8. Generate a bar chart to visualize the total cases for each country and save it as an image:
```python
y_pos = [i for i in range(1, len(countries) + 1)]
plt.bar(y_pos, cases[::-1], align='center', alpha=0.5)
plt.xticks(y_pos, countries[::-1], rotation=90)
plt.ylabel('total cases')
plt.title('Persons affected by coronavirus')
plt.savefig('corona.png', dpi=1000)
plt.show()
```

## Output

The script generates two output files:

- `corona.csv`: A CSV file containing the COVID-19 data for individual countries.
- `corona.png`: An image file showing a bar chart of the total cases for each country.

Please note that the script relies on the structure and HTML elements of the Worldometer website. If the website's structure changes, the script may need to be modified accordingly.

Feel free to modify and use the code according to your requirements.
